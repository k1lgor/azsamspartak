# Design Document Update: FC Spartak Varna Fundraising Landing Page

**Project:** "Az sam Spartak" (I am Spartak) Fundraising Landing Page
**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Status:** Revision 2 (Minimalist Falcon Identity)

---

## 1. Updated Vision

The landing page has evolved from a structured card-based layout to a cinematic, minimalist identity. The focus is now on the "Sokol" (Falcon) imagery and the club's official logo, integrated into a high-impact background. Interaction is focused on the Loading Screen (Variant B) followed by a clean, text-driven information flow.

## 2. Updated Components

### Loading Screen (Variant B - PULSE)

- **Visuals:** Dark background, no logo.
- **Animation:** Pulse effect on text "Аз... Съм... СПАРТАК!".
- **Outcome:** Establishes emotional connection before revealing the site.

### Hero Section (Minimalist)

- **Visuals:** Fixed background with integrated official logo and Falcon silhouette.
- **Content:** Headline "Вчера. Днес. Утре. Спартак завинаги!" in blue/white.

### Donation Information (Minimalist Columns)

- **Structure:** Two-column text layout, no borders, no cards.
- **Left Column (200 €):** Standard donation benefits using bullet points.
- **Right Column (500 €):** Premium benefits highlighted with gold typography.
- **Footer Text:** Center-aligned information about free donations and the Donor Wall.

### IBAN & Contact Section

- Retains functional copy-to-clipboard for IBAN.
- Minimalist integration with the background.

## 3. Tech Stack Refresh

- **Styling:** CSS Grid for the 2-column info layout, `text-shadow` for readability on image backgrounds, `glassmorphism` subtle effects.
